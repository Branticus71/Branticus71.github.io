## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
I am going to be using more ensemble methods like trees. This was the first class I have taken that involved them and I found them really interesting and useful. In addition, unsupervised learning is very interesting and something I want to start using more often.

## Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? 
I hope to get a job as a data analyst or data scientist in the near future but I have no specific field of interest yet; maybe something medical related. 
I want to learn more about machine learning in general and probably Python as well. It seems like Python is becoming more and more popular for data science so I may need to start learning it.
