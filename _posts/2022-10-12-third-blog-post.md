# Thoughts

## What I did
On this project, I helped create a vignette for the Spoonacular API which involved the creation of functions to call the API and some exploratory data analysis.
## What I Found Difficult
I found managing the pushing and pulling in git to be fairly difficult for a good portion of the project. Particularly when multiple people were working on the repo at the same time so things were getting updated very frequently.
I had to spend some time learning how to deal with merge conflicts and using git commands within the terminal itself for one particularly bad case. In addition, working with an API that has a limited quota was quite frustrating.
I tend to run my code quite a bit so I frequently used up my daily quota and had to either make another account or simply work on something else.
## What I Learned
I learned a lot about git in particular on this assignment from the functionality within R to actually using the terminal commands themselves to get my issues fixed.
In addition, I feel like I learned the importance of really understanding your code before you run it. I kept using up my daily quota because I would just sometimes enter in some code that I wasn't sure would work just to try it.
By having a better understanding of how each function works it cut down on all the wasted API requests that I had been doing at the start of the project and I was much more productive towards the backend of the project.
