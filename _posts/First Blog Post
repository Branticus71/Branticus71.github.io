### What do you think being a data scientist is about?
Being a data scientist is about taking large amounts of data then analyzing it to find and present actionable insights for your employer. 

### What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?
The major duties and knowledge areas from what I read are data manipulation, visualization, analysis, and machine learning.

### What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?
They seem very similar, if I had to point to one thing that separates them the most it would be that data scientists seem more interested in prediction than statisticians. As in given a person's shopping history what items are they most likely to buy next versus something like why do people who buy this item also tend to buy these other items.

### How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
My background is in economics where we focus heavily on identifying, explaining, and quantifying relationships in data so I think my skillset and experience matches more closely to a statistician than data scientist.
