# Blog Post for ST558 Project 3

## Summary
This project was on automating reports in R using parameters. I created a unique .html file for each data channel parameter that had visualizations and predictive models.

## What Would I do Differently
In the future, I would like to try to automate the analysis and descriptions of my visualizations. I have a couple ideas in my head about how to do this and I think it would be very interesting.

## What was the Most Difficult Part for Me
I found the project itself to be fairly straightforward and most difficulties came about due to my group partner being sick. Besides that, I think trying to create general descriptions of what to look for in the visualizations was somewhat challenging. I just could never really find a way to really thoroughly explain everything that should be looked for in the graphs and tables in a succinct manor.

## What are my Big Take-Aways from this Project?
R is very good at automating reports and I am sure that taking advantage of this will save many hours of my life once I enter into my career in data.
