# My Generic EDA Strategy Plan

## Step 1: Familiarization
Whenever I am given data the first thing I always do is familiarize myself with it. Typically by answering the following questions:

- How are missing values handled? 
    - I have seen datasets that handle missing responses or variables in many different ways. Sometimes they always impute to remove them, sometimes they leave them as default, and I have seen them get coded as negative numbers to indicate the reason the value is missing.
- What does each variable represent? What type of variables are they?
    - Sometimes the names of variables aren't totally clear as to what they capture so if there is a codebook or something along those lines it should be read for each variable.
- What is the best way to table/graph these variables?
    - Create a basic plan for starting the EDA.
## Step 2: Summary Statistics and Graphs
Exploring summary information about the variables

- For continuous variables
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Standard Deviation
    - Min
    - Max
    - 25th Percentile
    - 75th Percentile
- For categorical/discrete variables
    - Frequency
    - Percent/Proportion
    - Histograms

## Step 3: Relationships
Begin thinking about the relation between different variables in the data and use methods to explore. Use some simple/basic analysis to show evidence for or against relationsips.

- Graphs like scatter plots and box plots
- Correlation
- Regression analysis

## Step 4: Conclusion
Finish by summarizing interesting findings and suggestions for further analysis.
